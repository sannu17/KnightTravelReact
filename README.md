## SpaceXLaunch Program

1. SpaceXLaunch component renders the filter view with child component LaunchProgramDetail rendering satellite details.
2. On initial render API to fetch full details is called.
3. Filter can be applied on Launch year, success launch and success land, all these filters can be applied together as well1.
4. On filter url will also change and page is not getting refreshed on applying filter.
5. Clear filter is extra add on once you apply all the filter and you want to clear them all then click 'Clear Filter' botton.
6. I have used 'N/A' in case data is not coming from API

NOTE - The key 'launch_landing' given for Successful Landing mismatch with query param 'land_success' please verify. Also we are not able to get any data based on 'launch_landing'

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
